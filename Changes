Revision history for Perl extension CGI::ToXML.

0.09  Mon Jun 7 1999
	- Bug fix for when typing a / in the form field

0.08  Internal bug fix release

0.07  Wed Jan 27 1999
	- Speed improvements. Now faster than XML::XQL (DOM) for all cases
	- Some minor bug fixes
	- Fixes to Stream mode

0.06  Fri Jan 22 1999
	- "Pretty" XML fixed.
	- Removed ToCGI - that was a dumb name!
	- Fixed - the module was actually totally broken, except
    	in a mod-perl environment where we'd already included
		XML::Parser at the server level.

0.05  Thu Jan 21 1999
	- Used parse_params again. For some reason $self->query_string
	  isn't in the order it's recieved from the browser. Grr.
	- Renamed to CGI::XMLForm after discussion with J.Eisenzopf.
	- Added readXML function.
	- tries to make "pretty" XML. Fails <g>.
	- Encoding should have been ISO-8859-1. Duh!

0.04  Thu Jan 14 1999
	- Fixed bug in relative (parent) paths
	- Added xml encoding="ISO-8859-2"
	- Don't overload parse_params any more - that could be problematic.
	- Don't allow people to enter entities in forms any more (always
	  encodes & as &amp; from now on, even if followed by \w+;).
	- Thought very hard about rewriting to be neater,
		but didn't bother in the end ;-) Next version maybe!

0.03  Wed Jan 06 1999
	- Syntax updates
	- Allow relative paths
	- Improved docs
	- Improved examples
	- Some bug fixes
	- Properly deal with fixed entities (&,<,>,',")
	- Properly subclasses CGI.pm
